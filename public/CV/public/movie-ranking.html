<h1>The Best Movies According to Jessica</h1>
<h2>My top 3 films of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is the movie that introduced me to Studio Ghibli. <br />
    I still enjoy watching it when I want to feel nostalgic. <br />
    My favourite part is the food that is seen.</p>

<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>One of my favourite musicals. <br />
Satine's story is still one of my favourite's to this day.</p>

<h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
<p>This is just a solid feel-good movie and is mandatory watching for its genre.</p>
